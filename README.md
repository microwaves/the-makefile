# the-makefile

Very simple and generic `Makefile` for Go projects. It builds binaries for multiple platforms, static binaries for *nix and creates Docker images.

## Install

On the root of your project, execute:

```
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microwaves/the-makefile/master/Makefile
```

Open it, edit and have fun building. :-)
